To use, simply pass the thread as a command line argument
ex:
$ python imagescraper.py http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/15898894

Which will create (if it doesn't exist) a g/15898894/ directory and download the images to that location.
You may also give links to 4chan boards as arguments.

It's possible to change the amount of threads used to download images (default: 32)
ex:
$ python imagescraper.py -t 16 http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/15898894

Which will force the program to at most download 16 images simulatenously.

It's also possible to change the output directory (default: current directory)
ex:
$ python imagescraper.py -o ~/Pictures/4chan/ http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/15898894

This is the help message produced by the -h option:
usage: imagescraper.py [-h] [--version] [-t n] [-o directory] [-q]
                       links [links ...]

positional arguments:
  links                 link to a 4chan thread or board if the --board/-b
                        option is specified

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             prints the version and exits
  -t n, --threads n     number of threads to use for multi-threading
  -o directory, --output directory
                        where to create the directory hierarchy
  -q, --quiet           do not print messages to screen, mutually exclusive
                        with -v/--verbose

I initially don't really plan to work on this very much but I have some ideas, feel free to mail me with ideas for features or bugs at trulses@gmail.com
