To use, simply pass the thread as a command line argument
ex:

$ python imagescraper.py http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/15898894#15899068

Which will create (if it doesn't exist) a g/15898894/ directory and download the images to that location.

I initially don't really plan to work on this very much but I have some ideas, feel free to mail me with ideas for features or bugs at trulses@gmail.com
